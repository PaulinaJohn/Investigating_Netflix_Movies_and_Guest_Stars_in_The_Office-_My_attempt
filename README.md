This guided datacamp project is about investigating whether the duration of movies on netflix have been declining over the years. 

A short story......

This was one of my projects before my python skills became toosh..... lolzz
So, while I am aware that researching for solutions is a key skill for any tech person, professional or enthusiast, and I pride myself in having the inherent ability to ask the right questions in my online searches that point me to the exact solution I need nearly all the time, the highlight on this project, for me, was challenging myself to keep reviewing and adjusting my codes until i fix any bug I cause, as opposed to giving up quickly and resorting to researching the solution online.

The challenge worked quite well!. I was able to complete 9 out of 10 tasks all by myself.
