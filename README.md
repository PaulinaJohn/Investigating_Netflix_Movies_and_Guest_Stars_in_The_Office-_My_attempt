a short story......
At the time I attempted this project on DataCamp, my python skills were not as good as now... lolzz
So the highlight for me, on this project, was challenging myself to keep reviewing and adjusting until i fix any bug that emerges from my codes. 
I was able to complete 9 out of 10 tasks all by myself, adjusting my codes myslef until I fix my own bugs, rather than quickly give up and resort to researching the solution online.
So, while researching for solutions is a key skill for any tech person, and I pride myself in having the inherent ability to ask the precise question in my online searches that point me to the exact solution I need nearly all the time I challenged myself to  not research
